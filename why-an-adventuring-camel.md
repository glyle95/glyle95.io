Because, why not!? My story begins at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in May 2016. My future travel companion was practicing riding a camel for her upcoming trip to Israel. She saw me outside the camel rides in the gift shop and just thought I was cutest thing ever! Her mom actually brought me for her, and my travel companion snapped a picture of me in front of my fellow camels. Her mom and her got the great idea that she should take me with her to Israel and take pictures of me during her adventures. Our Israel trip only lasted 10 weeks, but here we are 3 years later still adventuring away! How can we stop when there's still so many cool [places](http://localhost:4000/travel-wish-list/) to see?
